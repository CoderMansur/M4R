def min_weighted_dominating_set(G, weight=None):
    r"""Returns a dominating set that approximates the minimum weight node
    dominating set.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
        Undirected graph.

    weight : string
        The node attribute storing the weight of an node. If provided,
        the node attribute with this key must be a number for each
        node. If not provided, each node is assumed to have weight one.

    Returns
    -------
    min_weight_dominating_set : set
        A set of nodes, the sum of whose weights is no more than `(\log
        w(V)) w(V^*)`, where `w(V)` denotes the sum of the weights of
        each node in the graph and `w(V^*)` denotes the sum of the
        weights of each node in the minimum weight dominating set.

    Notes
    -----
    This algorithm computes an approximate minimum weighted dominating
    set for the graph `G`. The returned solution has weight `(\log
    w(V)) w(V^*)`, where `w(V)` denotes the sum of the weights of each
    node in the graph and `w(V^*)` denotes the sum of the weights of
    each node in the minimum weight dominating set for the graph.

    This implementation of the algorithm runs in $O(m)$ time, where $m$
    is the number of edges in the graph.
