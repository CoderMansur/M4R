Functions to add/complete:

Sparsification function: implements various sparsification techniques and identifies important edges etc
Smallworldness function: implement the omega function - need to construct a lattice. networkx implementation is too slow.
Graph similarity measures: Build a similarity space between all graphs according to some kernel and then use the coordinates in that space
as a new feature.
Scalefree function: This needs massive expansion...
