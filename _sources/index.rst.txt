*hcga*: Highly Comparative Graph Analysis
============================================

*hcga* is inspired by *hctsa*, the time serie massive feature extraction framework of [Hctsa]_ and instead extracts features from graphs to classify or regress them.  
This code comes with the companion paper [Hcga]_  containing more details and examples of applications. 

How to install HCGA
-------------------

Navigate to the folder with setup.py and type:

```pip install .```
