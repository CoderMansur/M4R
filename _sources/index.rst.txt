**hcga**: Highly Comparative Graph Analysis
============================================

**hcga** is inspired by the time serie massive feature extraction framework of [Hctsa]_ and instead extracts features from graphs to classify or regress them.  
This code comes with the companion paper [Hcga]_  containing more details and examples of applications.
